# CS:GO Match Calendar

This repository scrapes HLTV's [upcoming matches page](https://www.hltv.org/matches?predefinedFilter=top_tier) and turns into a Google Calendar friendly CSV, for schedule importing.

Mainly made on IEM New York 2020's period but technically it works for any match listed on HLTV's upcoming matches page (default set to Top Tier matches).
